# Digital Padlock - MSA 2021 Competition

Digital Padlock is created to mimic real life padlock inside the web browser. This project is a participation to 2021 MSA Competition.

# 🙌 Getting Started

# 🎨 Design
Digital Padlock is inspired by Neumorphic Design which has been a popular design trend since early 2020. Neumorphism is a minimalise desian that distinguishes different objects by lightening up exposed surfaces and addling shadows to them.

# 📝 Functionalities
### Lock and Unlock
You can lock and unlock by simply toggling the Lock/Unlock button (Ofcourse, the passcode must be correct if you wish to unlock!).
